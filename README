HTML5 Uploader in YUI3

An experiment in working with the HTML5 File API for async file uploads using YUI3.

NOTE: I have temporarily put this project on hold. The current implemetation 
of YUI3 io, while appropriate for 99% of current use cases, isn't flexible
enough for the needs of this particular project. Luke Smith 
(http://github.com/lsmith/) is working on a prototype to replace the current
io implementation that looks really promising. I am planning to devote some
time to that project.
